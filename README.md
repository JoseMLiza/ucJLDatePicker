# ucJLDatePicker
UserControl DatePicker GDI/GDI+ VB6
ucJLDTPicker is a user control created to be used in modern forms, which can be adjusted to some cooler layouts with its multiple properties.

This is its first version, which enters a trial period since it may present some undetected errors in the process, for this reason it will be appreciated if they can be reported.

This has a very important property, which allows us to use the control as a child of some form or float and linked to another control, this is called IsChild.

In the project, a control called ucText created by Leandro Ascierto has been used, which can be found on his website http://leandroascierto.com/blog/uctext-custom-texbox-unicode/
